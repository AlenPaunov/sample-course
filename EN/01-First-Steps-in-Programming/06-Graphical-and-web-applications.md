# Exercises: graphical and web applications

Now we are about to build one simple **web application** and one simple **graphical application**, in order to take a look at what we will be able to create when we progress with programming and software development. We are not going to look through the details about the used techniques and constructions fundamentally, rather we are just going to take a look at the arrangement and functionality of our creation. After we progress with our knowledge, we will be able to do bigger and more complex software applications and systems. We hope that the examples given below will **enlighten your interest**, rather than make you give up.
