# Chapter 3.2. Simple Conditions - Exam Problems

In the previous chapter, we went through the simple conditions in C#, which we can use to execute different actions depending on a given condition. We mentioned what **the scope ** of a variable is and how to track the execution of our program step by step (the so-called **debugging**) as well. In this chapter, we will practice working with simple conditions by going through some exam tasks. To do this, let's first revise their construction:

```csharp
if (boolean expression)
{
    // condition body;
}
else
{
    // Ðµlse-construction body;
}
```

`if` conditions** consist of:
 - `if` clause**
 - boolean expression - a variable of boolean type (`bool`) or boolean logical expression (an expression that results in `true/false`)
 - condition body - contains random block of source code
 - `else` clause** and its block of source code (**optional**)
