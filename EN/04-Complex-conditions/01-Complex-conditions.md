# Chapter 4.1. Complex conditions

In the **current** chapter, we are going to look at the **nested conditional statements** in the language **C#**, by which our program can contain **conditions**, which contain other **nested conditional statements**. We call them **"nested"**, because **we put an `if` condition** into **another `if` condition**. We are going to look at the **more complex logical conditions** through proper examples.

## Nested conditions

Pretty often the program logic inflicts the use of **`if`** or **`if-else`** statements, which are contained one inside the other. They are called **nested** **`if`** or **`if-else`** statements. As it implied from the title **"nested"**, these are **`if`** or **`if-else`** statements, which are placed inside other **`if`** or **`else`** statements.

```csharp
if (condition1)
{
    if (condition2)
    {
        // body; 
    }
    else
    {
        // body;
    }
}
```

The nesting of more than three conditional statements inside each other is not considered a good practice and has to be avoided, mostly through optimization of the structure/the algorithm of the code and/or through using another type of conditional statement, which we are going to see below in this chapter.
