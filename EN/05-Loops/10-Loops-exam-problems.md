# Chapter 5.2. Loops - Exam Problems

In previous chapter we learned how to run a block of commands **more than once**. That's why we introduced a `for` loop** and reviewed its main uses. The purpose of this chapter is to improve our knowledge ,with solving some more complicated problems with loops, used for exam contests. For some of them we will show sample of detailed solutions, and for others we will leave only guidance.

## For loops

Before we start working,it will be good to review again construction of `for` loop**:

**For loops** consists of:
- Initialization block in which the variable-counter is declared (`var i`) and its initial value is set.
- Repeat condition (`i <= 10`), executing once, before every iteration of the loop.
- Refreshing of the counter (`i++`) â€“ this code is executed after each iteration.
- Body of the loop - contains random block with source code.
